      </header>
      <ol>
        <li>I moved to the USA in 2005 to undertake a postdoctoral fellowship. I planned to stay for 4 or 5 years.</li> 
        <li>I met my husband and got married in 2008.</li>
        <li>I stopped working and had 2 adorable daughters, in 2009 and 2011.</li>
        <li>My daughters are now in school and I'm excited, and scared, to return to work.</li>
        <li>I became a US citizen in 2016.
        <li>We adopted a kitten in 2016. I used to dislike cats, but now I ADORE them!</li>
        <li>I hope to return to work this year, 2017... fingers crossed!</li>

        <h2>I still don't really GET GitHub!</h2>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <li> I'm still having trouble navigating my way around.</li>
        <li> I have no idea how I can view these changes I'm making to see if they work....oh, got it now! woohoo!</li> 
        <li> Do I commit my changes everytime I want to see if what I have done has worked?</li>
        <li> Maybe with more time and practice it will become easier!</li>
        <li> So many questions, so little time.</li>
